Please, follow this template when opening a new issue: this will help us a lot in the process of helping you.

Try to give us every information you can: sometimes **big** problems are caused by _little_ details!

### Issue description
Tell us what happened: don't miss any valuable detail, try to be clear and concise, don't use UPPERCASE or abbreviations which can make understanding what you wrote quite difficult.

### Firmware version
Always remember to write what version of MK4duo you're using

### My setup
1. If you configured MK4duo with the online configurator, attach here your `Configuration_Overall.h` file.

2. Otherwise, if you configured MK4duo manually through the config files, write here a list of the main settings you think may be related to the issue, like this:
- SETTING_1    true
- SETTING_2    25
- SETTING_3    "blablabla"
- ...

_If needed, you'll be asked for other settings you modified._

Please be patient, we'll be trying to help you as soon as possible.
